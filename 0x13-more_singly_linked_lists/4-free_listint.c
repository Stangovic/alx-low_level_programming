Here's an implementation of the `free_listint` function in C:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "lists.h"

void free_listint(listint_t *head)
{
    listint_t *current = head;
    listint_t *next;

    while (current != NULL)
    {
        next = current->next;
        free(current);
        current = next;
    }
}
```

This function takes a pointer to the head of a linked list of `listint_t` nodes, and frees all the nodes in the list. It does this by iterating through the list, starting at the head, and freeing each node in turn. 

To free each node, the function first saves a pointer to the next node in the `next` variable, so that it can continue iterating through the list after the current node has been freed. It then calls the `free` function to deallocate the memory used by the current node. Finally, it updates the `current` variable to point to the next node, which was saved earlier in `next`.

Note that the `lists.h` header file is assumed to define the `listint_t` type.
