Here's an implementation of the function `listint_len` that returns the number of elements in a linked list:

```
#include "lists.h"

/**
 * listint_len - returns the number of elements in a linked listint_t list.
 * @h: pointer to the head of the list
 *
 * Return: number of elements in the list
 */
size_t listint_len(const listint_t *h)
{
    size_t count = 0;

    while (h != NULL)
    {
        count++;
        h = h->next;
    }

    return (count);
}
```

This function takes a pointer to the head of the list as its argument and iterates through the list, counting each element until it reaches the end. The variable `count` is used to keep track of the number of elements in the list. Once the end of the list is reached, the function returns the value of `count`.
