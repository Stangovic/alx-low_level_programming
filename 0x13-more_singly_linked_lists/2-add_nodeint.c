Here's a possible implementation of the `add_nodeint` function in C:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "lists.h"

typedef struct listint_s {
    int n;
    struct listint_s *next;
} listint_t;

listint_t *add_nodeint(listint_t **head, const int n) {
    listint_t *new_node = malloc(sizeof(listint_t));
    if (new_node == NULL) {
        return NULL;  // allocation failed
    }
    new_node->n = n;
    new_node->next = *head;
    *head = new_node;
    return new_node;
}
```

This function takes a pointer to the head of the list (`head`) and an integer value (`n`) as arguments. It allocates memory for a new `listint_t` node using `malloc`, checks if the allocation was successful, sets the value of the `n` member to `n`, sets the `next` pointer of the new node to the current head of the list (`*head`), and finally updates the `head` pointer to point to the new node. It returns a pointer to the new node, or `NULL` if the allocation failed.
